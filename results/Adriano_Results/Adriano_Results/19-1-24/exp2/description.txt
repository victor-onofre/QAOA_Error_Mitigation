For each problem,a group of inner experiments notebooks will be done.Each group of notebooks is inside their respective
problem folder:


Analysis of some solutions found:
	This inner experiment use as input the different imgs created during 19-1-24/exp1.
	It also uses the excel "results_comparison". For each problem proccesed in
	19-1-24/exp1, we take the combination of parameters with:

		1- lowest cost
		2- highest cost
		3- lowest amount of iterations
		4- highest amount of iterations

	and make an analysis over the result, in particular over:

		* the most probable state/s and its bitstring energy
		* the bitstrings with lowest cost measured, and tehir respective
	  	energy.

Testing depolarizing noise and ZNE:
	This inner experiment use as input the lowest cost parameter combination created during 19-1-24/exp1.
	We repeat a QAOA optimization with these paremeters under the following conditions:

	* Adding depolarizing noise
    		* We will add one qubit noise and two qubits noise separately
    		* we will combine different one qubit noise values and two qubits noise values
    		* The values are taken from ibm_osaka, 23/1/2024
	* Trying to mitigate the depolarizing noise with ZNE
    	* it will be done for each combination of noise values

	We will plot the comparison of the cost history between Ideal VS. Noisy VS. Mitigated for each noise values combination.
