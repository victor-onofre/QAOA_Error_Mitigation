This directory has the different experiments done by Adriano for the QOSF project. First, in this same directory, you could find folders whose name
corresponds to the date (dd/mm/yy) where experiments where done.

Inside each date folder, there are "exp X" folders, where X says the number of the experiment. Each experiments has one/multiple description and conditions
files.

	*Description file is a general explanation over the experiment. The goal of it, what has been done and how to see the information it had been
	obtained.

	*Conditions file gives a description of the conditions that we choose to run the experiment. This is important in case you wanna replicate the
	results of it.
