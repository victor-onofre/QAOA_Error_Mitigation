We run 3 different circuits over an Maxcut instance:

1- QAOA algorithm with OpenQAOA
2- QAOA algorithm with OpenQAOA adding a noise model
3- QAOA algorithm with OpenQAOA, adding a noise model and mitigation with ZNE from Mitiq.

For that, we plot multiple cost histories and probabilities distributions.
